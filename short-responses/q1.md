# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer

The middleware function is different from a normal controller because they pass the client request to the next controller without sending anything response back to the client. They sit in the middle of the client and the server.

                    Client
                       |
                       |
                       |
                   Middleware
                 /     |     \
                /      |      \
               /       |       \
              /   controller2   \
         controller1          controller3
